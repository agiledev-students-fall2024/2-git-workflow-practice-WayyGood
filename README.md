# Game Development Trends in 2024: Crisis and Opportunity

## My Thoughts
What I find particularly interesting about the article is the transformative role generative AI is playing in the game development process, especially in areas like 2D art creation and its growing influence on 3D asset production. The ability to simplify and enhance artistic processes using AI technologies like LoRA and ControlNet highlights the immense potential for efficiency gains. While 2D art has already seen significant advancements, the complexity of 3D, (requiring model generation, rigging, animation, and scene composition) suggests it will take longer to mature, but itâ€™s fascinating that the large investment from academic, corporate, and startup teams could accelerate this process. The eventual integration of these technologies into a seamless workflow seems poised to revolutionize how games are made.

## Toby's Comment
I do think generative AI can play a major role in the graphics generation within games, but I do not see a reasonable timeframe for when 3D asset production become a part of a gamer's daily life. As you mentioned, the model generations, rigging, animation, and scene composition require massive computation power, all of which are fit into a game. This will involve not only a very powerful machine on the server side, but also high computational power on the user's side. What can help achieve this is the continuation of chips innovation and manufacturing from major companies like TSMC, Nvidia, and others. With where the current state of chips production is, there remains multiple headwinds in the plateau of chips advancement, global political conflicts, and deciding whether 3D modeling is the best place to invest resources in.
