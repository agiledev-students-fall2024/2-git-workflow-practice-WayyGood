# Game Development Trends in 2024: Crisis and Opportunity

## My Thoughts
What I find particularly interesting about the article is the transformative role generative AI is playing in the game development process, especially in areas like 2D art creation and its growing influence on 3D asset production. The ability to simplify and enhance artistic processes using AI technologies like LoRA and ControlNet highlights the immense potential for efficiency gains. While 2D art has already seen significant advancements, the complexity of 3D, (requiring model generation, rigging, animation, and scene composition) suggests it will take longer to mature, but itâ€™s fascinating that the large investment from academic, corporate, and startup teams could accelerate this process. The eventual integration of these technologies into a seamless workflow seems poised to revolutionize how games are made.
